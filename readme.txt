The goal of this project was described as follows:

"Suppose that the emergency room of a hospital sees a sudden and drastic increase in patients presenting with a particular set of symptoms. Doctors determine the cause to be bacterial, but without knowing the specific species involved they are unable to treat patients effectively. One way of identifying the cause is to obtain a DNA sample and compare it against known bacterial genomes. With a set of similarity scores, doctors can make more informed decisions regarding treatment, prevention, and tracking of the disease."

When run, my program displays a menu which has the following options:
1. Calculate Similary Score
2. Find the Best Similarity Score
3. Analyze the Genome Sequences
4. Quit
The menu runs on a loop, continually offering the user four options until they choose quit. Depending on each option, the program will ask for genomes and sequence inputs, and calculate the appropriate answer. 

This project was created in my Computer Science 1 college course.
